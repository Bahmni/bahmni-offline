I had to make one modification after downloading these files from https://github.com/likeastore/ngDialog/tree/master/css
because with the files as-downloaded the overlay was appearing on top of the content.

I added (in both ngDialog.css and ngDialog.min.css)
    position: relative;
to
    .ngdialog-content { ... }
